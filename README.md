## kubernetes-release

This project is an experiment to see if open source kubernetes and supporting software from coreos (e.g. flannel) can be deployed and managed in a production-suitable manner, as opposed to [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster).

#### TODO:

- find a better solution than `fake-git`
- see if flannel can be run not as root
- the rest of [this](https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/deploy-master.html)
- then [this](https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/deploy-workers.html)
- then [this](https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/configure-kubectl.html)
